Creating a Google Chrome extension to automate scraping 5000 leads (from Med Spa, Used Car Dealerships, and Car Detailing Studios) using a scraping tool like "Instant Data Scraper" is not straightforward because the extension itself wouldn't directly interface with a third-party extension like "Instant Data Scraper". However, you can create a custom Chrome extension to automate the scraping process, gather the required data, and store it in a desired format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
How the process works:

    Instant Data Scraper Integration: The extension would run or trigger "Instant Data Scraper" functionality for scraping data from the targeted websites (Med Spa, Car Dealerships, etc.).
    Data Extraction: It will scrape details like business name, phone, email, and area.
    Exporting Data: The extension could save or send the data to a server or file (like CSV or JSON).

Steps:

    Use "Instant Data Scraper":
        Instant Data Scraper extension allows you to scrape data easily from web pages. However, you need to perform some manual steps to trigger the scraping process as this is a user-driven tool.
    Create a Chrome Extension:
        The custom Chrome extension will automate interaction with web pages (by triggering the scraper) and export the collected data.

The following will demonstrate how to build a Chrome extension that can automate the task. However, for fully automated web scraping (such as continuously scraping 5000 leads from different websites), you'd ideally use a more specialized tool like a headless browser script (e.g., Puppeteer or Selenium), not just a Chrome extension. Here, I'll show how you could build the structure.
Chrome Extension Code:

    Manifest File (manifest.json): Defines the extension's permissions and other configurations.

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "Lead Scraper",
  "description": "Scrapes business leads from websites",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "storage",
    "tabs"
  ],
  "background": {
    "service_worker": "background.js"
  },
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icons/16.png",
      "48": "icons/48.png",
      "128": "icons/128.png"
    }
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/16.png",
    "48": "icons/48.png",
    "128": "icons/128.png"
  }
}

    Popup HTML (popup.html): A simple interface to interact with the extension.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Lead Scraper</title>
    <style>
      body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        padding: 10px;
      }
      button {
        padding: 8px 12px;
        font-size: 14px;
        cursor: pointer;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h3>Lead Scraper</h3>
    <p>Click to start scraping leads!</p>
    <button id="startScraping">Start Scraping</button>
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

    Popup JS (popup.js): Handles the button click to start scraping.

document.getElementById("startScraping").addEventListener("click", () => {
  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, (tabs) => {
    chrome.scripting.executeScript({
      target: { tabId: tabs[0].id },
      func: scrapeData
    });
  });
});

function scrapeData() {
  // Scrape the data (example)
  const name = document.querySelector("h1.business-name")?.innerText || "N/A";
  const phone = document.querySelector(".phone-number")?.innerText || "N/A";
  const email = document.querySelector(".email-address")?.innerText || "N/A";
  const area = document.querySelector(".location")?.innerText || "N/A";
  
  // This is where you'd collect all scraped data and send it back to background or store it.
  const leadData = {
    name,
    phone,
    email,
    area
  };

  console.log(leadData);

  // Send the lead data to the background script or save it to storage
  chrome.storage.local.set({ leadData });
}

    Background JS (background.js): This handles storage and possible interaction with the server or exporting the data.

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Lead Scraper Extension Installed");
});

// Listen for the scraping result and save it.
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.type === "scrapeData") {
    chrome.storage.local.set({ scrapedData: request.data });
  }
});

    Content JS (content.js): This script will interact with the webpage (for scraping purposes).

// Scrape required information (you can modify this selector based on the structure of the page)
const name = document.querySelector("h1.business-name")?.innerText || "N/A";
const phone = document.querySelector(".phone-number")?.innerText || "N/A";
const email = document.querySelector(".email-address")?.innerText || "N/A";
const area = document.querySelector(".location")?.innerText || "N/A";

// Send the data to background.js
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  type: "scrapeData",
  data: { name, phone, email, area }
});

    Icons: Make sure you have the icons (16.png, 48.png, 128.png) in an "icons" folder.

How it Works:

    User Interface: When users click on the extension icon, a popup appears with a button ("Start Scraping").
    Scraping: When the user clicks "Start Scraping," the extension will execute the scraping function on the current page, extracting the business name, phone, email, and area.
    Data Storage: The scraped data will be stored in Chrome's local storage, which you can later export or interact with.
    Customization: You may customize the selectors (document.querySelector()) to fit the specific structure of the websites you are scraping.

Key Notes:

    Scraping Limitations: Some websites may block or limit scraping, so you may need to implement techniques to avoid detection (e.g., user-agent rotation, rate limiting, etc.).
    Legal Considerations: Always be mindful of the legality of web scraping, especially regarding terms of service of the sites you're scraping.
    Manual Trigger: The scraping process is triggered manually by the user. Full automation would require additional tools like headless browsers (e.g., Puppeteer).

Extensions:

To automate the collection of 5000 leads, you would need to build functionality to handle pagination and multi-page scraping, handle retries for failed requests, and potentially integrate the scraped data into a backend service or database for analysis and storage.
